It would be better if his name is Liu Zhongji.
Last night, I had a nightmare and cried myself to wake up.
Fortunately,I dreamt of him and fall asleep again,warm and peace.
He is my predecessor and will graduate this summer.
As I know, he will work at Beijing and I have no courage to tell him.
Now, I decide to write a letter and sent to him at the end of this semester.
